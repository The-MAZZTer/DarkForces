Fixes were cherry picked from GitHub Issues for CSharpSynthForUnity (namely issues relating to locales which don't use . as the decimal character). I also made small modifications of my own so I could send some different data structures into CSharpSynth in a more efficient manner.

I also implemented audio playback in a completely different way for WebAssembly since it does not support the method CSharpSynthForUnity recommends.
